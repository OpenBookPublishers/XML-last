# XML-last

This repository contains a conversion tool from epub, generated using Adobe InDesign, to XML. For the conversion to work the InDesign documents need be formatted  following the set of instructions given below. The tool also relies on the use of consistent file and style naming conventions (controlled lists are also given below).

To run the conversion a transformation engine such as SaxonHE (https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/9.8/) will be needed although this open source edition does not allow the validation of the result documents.

* Files and directories
* Preparing the InDesign documents
* Book- and chapter-level metadata
* Object-level metadata
* Running the conversion
* The simplePrint schema and TEIPublisher
